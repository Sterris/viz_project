# Folder containing all the data sources we think could be interesting

### Idea 1: compare the response of governments to the outbreak across the globe.

On the one hand, I think it would be interesting to see and show how various indicators influence response to the outbreak: 

* Corruption index
* Political system (democracy VS totalitarian)
* Type of government (for democracies: Liberal, Conservative, Right/Left wing, etc.)
* Factors such as how well a country is doing economically, human development index, etc
* Cultural aspects (individualistic VS. altruistic cultures, etc.)
* Type of Healthcare system (universal healthcare VS private VS semi-private VS...)
* And more :-) 


And also, it would be interesting to see if we can find links between adopted measures (complete lockdown such as in China/Italy/Belgium, 'laissez faire' like in UK or Sweden, techno solutions like in South Corea/Taiwan/Hong Kong) and consequences on the spread of the pandemic - while also taking into account the above indicators.

**PRO**: Most of the data should be quite easy to come by, as it's quite easy to find out the answer to most of these questions. 

**CON**: It will likely require a decent amount of manual work, since it's unlikely that we will just find readymade datasets containing the data we need.

### Idea 2: Similar to the above, but instead of analyzing existing data, make some simulations and analyze the effects of different measures on the outcomes of the outbreak

So here the idea would be to code up some simulations that take into account as many parameters as we want, and to visualize how different responses together with different types of populations influence the final outcomes. 


Some examples of parameters could be:

- How much people normally interact with each other, including how much physical contact (eg. some cultures barely ever touch, others kiss profusely every time they meet)
- How much people move inside the population (i.e. do people tend to stay within their small community or do they travel around a lot)
- Population sizes
- Hygiene standards
- Tendency to listen to the authorities
- Access to doctors/medical professionals
- Available respirators/hospital beds
- Amount of medical professionals

It could also be interesting to compare our results to actual numbers to see how good the simulations are.

**PRO**: We don't need to actually gather any data, as we will generate it from the simulations. 

**CON**: This will require a significant amount of coding (for the simulation) that is not directly related to the visualization
