# Folder containing all the data sources we think could be interesting

### Idea 1: compare the response of governments to the outbreak across the globe.

**Focus on Europe**

On the one hand, I think it would be interesting to see and show how various indicators influence response to the outbreak: 

**Corruption Index, Political System, Type of Government, GDP, Religion, Debt, Healthcare system, Number of cases and timeline, ages of infected individuals, weather, population distribution (ages of general population), funding pledged to stop COVID-19.**

**GDP and public debt compared with how much funding has been pledge to stop COVID-19**
**Number of cases before an individual government put the country in lockdown. (Bubble plot, y = no of cases, x = date, colour = country)**
**Heat map movie showing evolution of cases over time**

* Corruption index
* Political system (democracy VS totalitarian)
* Type of government (for democracies: Liberal, Conservative, Right/Left wing, etc.)
* Factors such as how well a country is doing economically, human development index, etc
* Cultural aspects (individualistic VS. altruistic cultures, etc.)
* Type of Healthcare system (universal healthcare VS private VS semi-private VS...)
* And more :-) 


And also, it would be interesting to see if we can find links between adopted measures (complete lockdown such as in China/Italy/Belgium, 'laissez faire' like in UK or Sweden, techno solutions like in South Corea/Taiwan/Hong Kong) and consequences on the spread of the pandemic - while also taking into account the above indicators.

**PRO**: Most of the data should be quite easy to come by, as it's quite easy to find out the answer to most of these questions. 

**CON**: It will likely require a decent amount of manual work, since it's unlikely that we will just find readymade datasets containing the data we need.

**You will also need to find some continuous data to go with this like ages, number of cases, geographical data**

**Try and match the visualisations you want to create with visualisations we have done in the exercises**

### Idea 2: Similar to the above, but instead of analyzing existing data, make some simulations and analyze the effects of different measures on the outcomes of the outbreak

So here the idea would be to code up some simulations that take into account as many parameters as we want, and to visualize how different responses together with different types of populations influence the final outcomes. 


Some examples of parameters could be:

- How much people normally interact with each other, including how much physical contact (eg. some cultures barely ever touch, others kiss profusely every time they meet)
- How much people move inside the population (i.e. do people tend to stay within their small community or do they travel around a lot)
- Population sizes
- Hygiene standards
- Tendency to listen to the authorities
- Access to doctors/medical professionals
- Available respirators/hospital beds
- Amount of medical professionals

It could also be interesting to compare our results to actual numbers to see how good the simulations are.

**PRO**: We don't need to actually gather any data, as we will generate it from the simulations. 

**CON**: This will require a significant amount of coding (for the simulation) that is not directly related to the visualization

##Idea 3: See if any correlation between weather and development of covid-19
Initial hypothesis: when weather is nice people will go out more and therefore 
more people get infected. Maybe we can observe an increase around roughly 5 days after nice days,
because that's the incubation time.

Primarly was thinking of scandinavia, with the thought that they have rarly nice weather.
Would be possible to see if any linkage between weather other places as well.
I.e could we compare how the spreading is related to the average temperature of the place
Maybe difficult given that so many other factors....  


Pro: Should be possible to get data-sets and compare if this is happening in Scandinavia,
and then if it's observed other places as well.

Con: Maybe to narrow, difficult to generalize and "prove" any sort of correlation.




###Idea 4: See if any correlation between stock marked pandemic at the initial stage of development.
Background: https://www.npr.org/2020/03/31/824958381/justice-department-looking-into-senators-stock-selloff?t=1585931442189

In the early development of the covid19, before global crisis was announced in meadia, 
people with inside information sold their stocks resulting in a stock decline before the general
public was informed.

Therefore it could be interesting to compare the stock market with the measures taken by different goverments.
More specifically looking at how big companies stock development compared to the dates where the respective
goverments announced national crisis and took drastic measures. Hopefully we could observe a decline in the
stock marked a couple of days before the measures taken, then followed by increased infected people.
Could also be combined with other data about economics. 

Pro: Interesting. Easy to get stock-development of big companies. 

Con: Difficult to show an actual correlation.
